Heya! Thanks for using Groupy!

Instructions:

Download and unzip GroupyDownload

Save the .rsh somewhere stable (ex. local drive in a new folder named "Groupy")

Open Rhino and launch the plugin manager (type PluginManager)

Select install and browse to where you save the .rsh and select Groupy.rsh

Ensure that you enable the plugin and restart Rhino

Your first time using Groupy, open Rhino and type "GroupyPanel". This will open a panel that will enable Groupy and access other useful parameters. Your selections will persist and remain unchanged when you open Rhino from now on.

If you'd like to edit any parameters or toggle off the plugin, simply run the GroupyPanel command and make your changes.
